# RTCcheck
Check up to 8 DS3231 RTC's using a TCA9548 and an Arduino Nano ESP32, ESP32 C3, S3 or similar. A small sketch is included for Arduino UNO or similar. When using DS3231 time modules some are not function perfect. With this sketch and some wiring up to eight DS323 can be tested using the NTP time server as reference.
